        # MusicGen

        This is the demo for MusicGen, a simple and controllable model for music generation
        presented at: "Simple and Controllable Music Generation".

        Enter the description of the music you want and an optional audio used for melody conditioning.
        The model will extract the broad melody from the uploaded wav if provided.
        This will generate a 12s extract with the `melody` model.

        For generating longer sequences (up to 30 seconds) and skipping queue, you can duplicate
        to full demo space, which contains more control and upgrade to GPU in the settings.

        </p>

        You can also use your own GPU or a Google Colab by following the instructions on our repo.
